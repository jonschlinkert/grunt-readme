# DEPRECATED. Please use [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) instead.

grunt-readme was pretty useful, but it was buggy and limited in scope to be worth _really_ digging in and making it awesome. 

[Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) is a new project that, while sharing the same roots and inspiration as grunt-reamde, is far more powerful, flexible and can be used globally from the command line.

Please check it out, I hope you like it!

* Install [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) locally in projects that use Verb.
* Get [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) to use Verb from the command line
* Get [generator-verb](https://github.com/assemble/generator-verb) to add documentation templates, or initialize docs for new projects
* Get [grunt-verb](https://github.com/assemble/grunt-verb) to automate Verb in your Grunt tool-chains
* Get [gulp-verb](https://github.com/assemble/gulp-verb) to automate Verb in your gulp tool-chains
